# Extension scripts

The *raspiBackup* [Git Repository](https://github.com/framps/raspiBackup/tree/master/helper) contains various scripts,
which can be used to customize the functionality of *raspiBackup
of *raspiBackup* to the local requirements.

There are also [extensions](https://github.com/framps/raspiBackup/tree/master/extensions_userprovided),
which have been written by *raspiBackup* users and can be used at extension points.

Sample extensions can be installed with the installer and used as examples for your own extensions.

Details about the extensions are described [here](useful-helper-scripts.md).
