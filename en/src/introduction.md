This documentation is being built with new tools on a new platform...

Initially by copying the original text from framp's website.

Currently the structure isn't finalized and most pages are empty or "broken",
especially regarding links and formatting.
The German version is more complete yet.

That means: For now it's **work in progress**.

There are two language versions, *german* and *english*.
Dynamically selectable with the language selector on the top right.
