``` admonish info title="Work in progress"
This documentation is being built with new tools on a new platform...

Initially by copying the original text from framp's website.

Currently the structure isn't finalized and many pages are empty or "broken",
especially regarding links and formatting.

That means: For now it's only a **prototype** or ** work in progress**.

There are two language versions, *german* and *english*.
Dynamically selectable with the language selector on the top right.
(*English* is more or less empty currently.)
