# Installer - Invocation and options

## Invocation 

```
sudo raspiBackupInstallUI {Options}
```

There are two different ways to invoke the *raspiBackup* installer `raspiBackupInstallUI`
installer:

1. Invoke without options or with option `-t`
    The installer starts with a menu via which *raspiBackup* can be configured.
    Option `-t` controls whether crond or systemd is used.
1. Invoke with options
    If an option other than `-t` is used, the installer executes the selected function
    immediately without a menu.

## Options

The following options allow the installer to perform certain functions directly without a menu:

* -i: Re/Installation of *raspiBackup*
* -e: Re/Installation of the *raspiBackup* sample extensions
* -h: Display a help text
* -U: Update from the installer `raspiBackupInstallUI
* -u: Uninstall *raspiBackup* including installer
* -t: Use either crond or systemd as backup timer with option -i, default is systemd

## Uninstallation

*raspiBackup* and the installer can also be uninstalled:

```
sudo raspiBackupInstallUI -u
```

**Note:**
This will delete the installer as well as *raspiBackup* with all its files!

### Backup versions - Menu C3

*raspiBackup* offers two different ways to store backup versions
to keep backup versions:

1. a *maximum number of backups* that is kept for each backup type (option -k).
   In the configuration file, the number of backups can be defined for each backup type (option
   can be defined for each backup type (option --keep\<type\>).
   If the number is exceeded, the oldest backup is deleted.

1. use of the *intelligent backup strategy*. Backups are created according to a specific rule
   of the last days, weeks, months and years. Older backups
   are deleted in each case. In the installer, the number of
   backups to be kept is defined with 4 numbers. The default is
   `7 4 12 3`.
 
   1. Daily backups (7)
   1. Weekly backups (4)

   The intelligent backup strategy is described in detail [here](smart-recycle.md).

### Services to stop and start - Menu C6

Since *raspiBackup* does not back up any memory contents, all services that hold important information
in memory should be stopped before the backup.

*raspiBackup* offers the option of automatically stopping services before the backup and then starting them again.
restart them afterwards. All services preselected in the installer should always be stopped.
As it cannot be ruled out that other services on the system may also hold important data
in the memory and should be stopped before the backup, the list of services that are not
active services must be carefully checked and, if necessary, these services must also be
services must also be selected so that they are stopped before the backup.

After selecting the services that are to be stopped, the order in which they are to be stopped must be defined.
in which they are to be stopped must be defined. In general, the sequence
sequence does not matter, but if a service has dependencies on another service, the service should

all services that work with a database should be stopped before stopping the database
so that they can complete any open transactions.
