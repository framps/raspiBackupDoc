# raspiBackup documentation 

The new documentation of *raspiBackup* is now differently organized. It's no longer 
published via Joomla on framps website and now is a dedicated project.

The source code of the documentation is no located in a repository and the documentation
is written in a *markdown*. The text files now can be edited very easily and are versioned.
That way it's possible to have multipe people - the *raspiBackup documentaion team* - to work on the 
documentation in parallel.

*Markdown* is one of many markup languages which can be used to convert  the contents
die sich mit Hilfe von Software gut in andere Formate, 
with help of software into different formats, e.g. a website.

To bring the result into an appealing and easy-to-navigate form,
naturally requires a little more "fiddling around".
